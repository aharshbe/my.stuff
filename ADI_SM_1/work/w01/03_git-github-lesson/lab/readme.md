# Git and GitHub Intro Lab

Let's apply what we've learned from class to share and update each other's code.  With a partner, you're going going to alternate between who 'drives' and who 'navigates' while following the requirements under "Exercise" below. The goal will be to create a project, have a partner fork, clone, and edit the project, submit the changes as a pull request, and then have the changes merged.  

Be sure to look at the previous lesson for notes and helpful hints.

## Exercise

Partners will be referred to as partner1 and partner2.

### Part 1

**With partner1 driving:**

- create a folder called `git-and-github-practice`
- within that folder create a new text file
- in that project, add some text
- initiate a git repository, commit your changes, and push to GitHub


**With partner2 driving, from their computer:**

- get your partners link to the GitHub repository and fork and clone it
- import the project
- add some more text
- commit your changes and submit a pull request back to partner1


**With partner1 driving:**

- merge the pull request from the GitHub interface


**Bonus**:

- push the updated local copy to GitHub


#### Deliverable

You should have a GitHub repository that have merged pull requests.
